# Release Readiness Micro-Course  
*A 5-Step Guide for Creators and Support Teams*

---

## Welcome  
This micro-course teaches creators how to avoid delayed releases by checking the most common issues that disrupt distribution. In five short lessons, you'll learn what to verify, why each step matters, and how to prepare your release for a smooth, on-time launch.

## Lesson 1 — Confirm Core Metadata  
**What to do:**  
Review the song title, artist name, collaborators, ISRC, artwork, and credits for accuracy.  

**Why it matters:**  
Most release delays happen because of simple metadata errors that stop distribution systems from accepting the upload.

---

## Lesson 2 — Check Distributor Delivery Status  
**What to do:**  
Confirm the project shows a clear “Delivered” or “In Review” status with no warnings or flagged items.  

**Why it matters:**  
If the system detects an issue, distribution pauses until the problem is resolved.

---

## Lesson 3 — Verify Date, Time, and Timezone  
**What to do:**  
Double-check the release date, time, and timezone, and submit uploads at least three to five days early.  

**Why it matters:**  
Small timing mistakes can cause a track to miss its scheduled drop, especially across global platforms.

---

## Lesson 4 — Confirm Collaborator Approvals  
**What to do:**  
Ensure all featured artists, producers, and writers have approved splits, credits, and rights.  

**Why it matters:**  
Pending approvals stop distribution entirely and often cause the biggest release-day delays.

---

## Lesson 5 — Scan for Red Flags  
**What to do:**  
Look for audio re-uploads, artwork changes, metadata edits, or stuck processing indicators.  

**Why it matters:**  
Last-minute changes frequently trigger review resets that delay the release.
